## Tools for Hypnokink Content Distribution

### Exactly how I do it

Email is handled through Protonmail. 

Resources Folder is through Tresorit, but Box is probably fine for you. 

Podcast is hosted on Anchor. 

Buttondown for the Newsletter. 

Telegram for Group Chats and texting without needing to share a phone number.

Website is EasyWP Hosting Package through Namecheap.

Domains are held in Cloudflare Register.

There are lots of other ways to do it. If you are interested, I have conducted a massive in-depth study of the hypnokink content distribution ecosystem. Message me on Telegram and I'll share my conclusions with you.

#### Email

https://protonmail.com/ - Recommended. Free Account.

https://mailbox.org/

https://tutanota.com/

#### File Hosting

https://www.box.com/ - Recommended

https://tresorit.com/  -  With Tresorit - do not use your real name as it CANNOT be changed after creation. Your email address is also visible to anyone you share a folder with, so use your Kink one from above.

https://mega.io/

#### Group Chat, Texting and Calls

https://telegram.org/ - Recommended

https://signal.org/

https://threema.ch/

Discord can also work, hypnokink discord is a collection of the most dysfunctional human beings on the planet and a massive time waster. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned. 

### Audio Content

https://anchor.fm/ - Recommended. 

https://soundgasm.net/ to stream audio files directly to people through the browser.

### Mailing List / Newsletter

https://buttondown.email/ is waaaaaay better than Mailchimp. Use it.

### Workshops / Live Events

https://www.teamup.com/ for creating a shared calender of content or to organise live events / presentations / etc

https://www.stickytickets.com.au/ for selling tickets to events.

https://www.jotform.com/ for creating forms to collect information.

### Written Content

https://obsidian.md/ or https://typora.io/ for creating and editing Markdown formatted text (seriously use this it will save you so much time) which will display consistently everywhere. 

https://copysmith.ai/ (Paid) for creating rough draft ad copy for your website, newsletter, etc.

### Monetise Your Content

https://gumroad.com/ - Recommended Store

https://ko-fi.com/

https://www.buymeacoffee.com/

https://www.warpmymind.com/ is one of the largest Hypnokink file marketplaces. 

## Standard Process

 1. Clarify the Intention of what you want to create. If it isn't written down it isn't real. 
 2. Create a Brand and Identity.
 3. Get an email address.
 4. Create Group Chat for your supporters.
 5. Create your Content. 
 6. Register for Filesharing Account.
 7. Create Website.
 8. Create Reddit / Fetlife or other social media account to popularise.

## Keys to Success

* Focus on Intention and answer the Content Creation Questions:

What is it intended to do?
Who is it for?
How will I know when it’s done?

* Avoid Drama. Do not make a publicly accessible Discord server. Do not allow known Hypnokink Troublemakers (See List) to access your content.
* Be true to yourself and your inner voice when it comes to who you are and what unique contributions you have to make to the world :-) Do not allow anyone else to make the decisions or do the thinking for you. Seek help and advice from people BEFORE you need it, but remember that you are under no obligation to follow it.
