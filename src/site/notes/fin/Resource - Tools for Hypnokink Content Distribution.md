## Standard Process

 1. Clarify the Intention of what you want to create. If it isn't written down it isn't real. 
 2. Create a Brand and Identity.
 3. Get an email address.
 4. Create Group Chat for your supporters.
 5. Create your Content. 
 6. Register for Filesharing Account.
 7. Create Website.
 8. Create Reddit / Fetlife or other social media account to popularise.

## Keys to Success

* Focus on Intention and answer the Content Creation Questions:

What is it intended to do?
Who is it for?
How will I know when itâ€™s done?

* Avoid Drama. Do not make a publicly accessible Discord server. Do not allow known Hypnokink Troublemakers (See List) to access your content.
* Be true to yourself and your inner voice when it comes to who you are and what unique contributions you have to make to the world :-) Do not allow anyone else to make the decisions or do the thinking for you. Seek help and advice from people BEFORE you need it, but remember that you are under no obligation to follow it.
