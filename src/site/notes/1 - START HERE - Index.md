#### Technical Details

Copies of all of these source files can be found in the Resources Folder, along with all of my other content.

Nerd Details: This site runs on a series of markdown-formatted text files, managed through Obsidian Notes, pushed to Github via the "Digital Garden"  Community Plugin by Ole Eskild Steensen, more details are here https://notes.ole.dev/set-up-your-digital-garden/ and rendered by Netlify.

Total control of content and versioning, zero hosting cost. 

#### Future Planned Updates
- [ ] Incorporate all Podcast Episode Notes as well
- [ ] Incorporate all previous published writings?
- [ ] Add a section for Hypnosis Scripts? are these better distributed as TXT files in Resources Folder?
